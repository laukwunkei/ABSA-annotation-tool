If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you. Boots up fast and runs great! Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us. I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am. This is my second MacBook. The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty. I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
