The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating. Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem. THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT. Im glad that it has such great features in it. it's just a great toy to have around. When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it. I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance. I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches, dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen. I had finally reached my limit and broke down. and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....
