I liked the aluminum body. Lightweight and the screen is beautiful! Buy it, love it, and I promise you won't regret it. From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple. pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were. Originally bought it for my wife. It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax. I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
